### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Jeremy, I am here to deepen my knowledge about data science and make some cool thing.
Researcher at heart I am curious of many things, and hope I can be useful for a maximum number of people.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on background noise removal with tensorflow
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning diverse data science/machine learning techniques
<!-- - ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
 - ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... -->
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about quantum mechanics/quantum info theory, probabilities, formal logic
- âš¡ Fun fact: In milonga (tango dance party) you don't directly ask someone for a dance. You do a "cabeceo".
- ðŸŽ® In my free time I like to hang with my friends, cook for them, dance tango, and learn a lot of things. In
particular I like to learn about the best ways to help others.

I also like to share some of the things I know. I hope you'll find something interesting on my [website](jrmy-rbr.github.io)
There, I post mostly about what I learn about data science/machine learning, but I'll digress to some more general topics when 
I get the time to do so.
